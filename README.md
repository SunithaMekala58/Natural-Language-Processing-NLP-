# Natural-Language-Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It involves various techniques like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, named entity recognition (NER), and more to process and analyze large volumes of text data. NLP is fundamental in developing applications like chatbots, sentiment analysis, translation systems, and automated content generation. This repository demonstrates key NLP concepts and methods for processing and understanding natural language.

# NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):
It is a comprehensive Python library used for working with human language data, providing tools for text processing, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization and more.

# Natural Language Understanding (NLU):
NLU is a subfield of NLP focused on enabling machines to comprehend and interpret human language by extracting meaning from text. It involves tasks like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition (NER), and syntactic analysis to understand the structure and semantics of language.

# Tokenization:
Tokenization is the process of splitting text into smaller units like words, sentences, or n-grams, enabling more structured analysis of the text. This includes word tokens, sentence tokens, blank-line tokens, white space tokens, word punctuation, bigrams, trigrams, and ngrams.

# Stemming: 
Stemming involves reducing words to their root form, often by removing suffixes, which helps in standardizing different variations of words for analysis.

# Lemmatization: 
Lemmatization reduces words to their base form or lemma, considering the word's meaning and context, making it more accurate than stemming for natural language processing tasks.

# Stopwords:
Stopwords are common words (like "and", "is", "the") that are typically removed in NLP to reduce noise and improve model efficiency, as they do not contribute significant meaning.

# Machine Understanding Grammar: 
Machine understanding of grammar involves the ability of an NLP system to comprehend syntactic and semantic structures in sentences, enhancing the machineâ€™s ability to process and interpret human language.

# NER (Named Entity Recognition): 
NER is a technique used to identify and classify named entities (like people, organizations, and locations) in text, crucial for extracting structured information from unstructured data.

# NLG (Natural Language Generation): 
NLG is the process of automatically generating human-like text based on data inputs, commonly used in applications like automated content creation and chatbots.

# WordCloud: 
WordCloud is a visual representation of the frequency of words in a given text, where the size of each word indicates its frequency, useful for quickly identifying key terms.
